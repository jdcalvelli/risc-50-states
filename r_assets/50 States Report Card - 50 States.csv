,"50-State Report Logistics:
- How did you quantify whether or not a course is “widely taken?

High level questions:
- Styling of the report. 
- One of the key question is who are we evaluating. Take Alabama vs. California. There is a lot of momentum in CA from on-the-ground entities, but the state hasn’t done a lot, precisely because it doesn’t need to. Alabama, on the other hand, has great state mandates, but on the ground situation might be much worse, since public universities still requiring the Geometry sandwich to be taught. 
- Should we count standards in com sci as evidence? Or should we focus on math curriculum?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
